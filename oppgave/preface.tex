\section*{Preface}
This report is a result of the specialization project TBA4560, at the Division of Geomatics, NTNU. The project was carried out the autumn of 2017 in cooperation with Rystad Enery, an international oil and gas knowledge house. The main supervisor has been Terje Midtb√∏, and Erik Wold the CTO of Rystad Energy has been the assisting supervisor.

Through the project the author has gotten a good understanding of the principles behind semantic segmentation and height estimation, and which methods that can be used to extract information from remote sensing data. Especially the field of machine learning has been very interesting to explore, because of the enormous potential that lies within its applications.

In general, the author feel that the project has provided a good insight as to how to write good and concise reports. \\[1pc]
