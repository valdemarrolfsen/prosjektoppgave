\section*{Abstract}
Cushing, Oklahoma, a major crude oil trading hub, is often referred to as the famous price settlement point for West Texas Intermediate of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lies a significant economic potential in knowing the inventory numbers of this area before they are released.

This paper investigates different approaches to estimate the total inventory using remote sensing techniques, including standard approaches for semantic segmentation, machine learning, height estimation using SAR and InSAR analysis and trigonometrical height estimation using building shadows cast by the sun.

These methods are then compared, evaluated and combined to find the approach that is most likely suitable for accurately retrieving the inventory numbers.
