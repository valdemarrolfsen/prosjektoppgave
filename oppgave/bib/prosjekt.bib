abstract = {State-of-the-art smart sensor technology enables deployment of dense arrays of sensors, which is critical for structural health monitoring (SHM) of complicated and large-scale civil structures. Despite recent successful implementation of various wireless smart sensor networks (WSSNs) for full-scale SHM, the low-cost micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors commonly used in smart sensors cannot readily measure low-level ambient vibrations because of their relatively low resolution. Combined use of conventional wired high-sensitivity sensors with low-cost wireless smart sensors has been shown to provide improved spectral estimates of response that can lead to improved experimental modal analysis. However, such a heterogeneous network of wired and wireless sensors requires central collection of an enormous amount of raw data and off-network processing to achieve global time synchronization; consequently, many of the advantages of WSSNs for SHM are lost. In this paper, the development of a new high-sensitivity accelerometer board (SHM-H) for the Imote2 wireless smart sensor (WSS) platform is presented. The use of a small number of these high-sensitivity WSSs, composed of the SHM-H and Imote2, as reference sensors in the Natural Excitation Technique—based decentralized WSSN strategy is explored and is shown to provide a cost-effective means of improving modal feature extraction in the decentralized WSSN for SHM.

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {Owing to the remarkable improvements that have been made in radar sensors, it becomes possible to obtain the information for a single structure from high-resolution SAR images. In our previous research, a method for detecting the heights of low-rise buildings automatically was proposed using 2D GIS data and a single high-resolution TerraSAR-X intensity image. However, this method is difficult to apply for high-rise buildings due to surface/material conditions of their exterior walls. In this study, a new method was developed for estimating the heights of high-rise buildings based on the results from an Interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis. The characteristics of phases in the InSAR result were investigated and used for extracting the potential layover areas of target buildings. Then, the heights were estimated according to their layover lengths. The developed method was tested on two TerraSAR-X images for San Francisco, USA, in the HighSpot mode. Comparing the result with Lidar data, the detected heights were found to be reasonable.},

abstract = {Computer vision applications have come to rely increasingly on superpixels in recent years, but it is not always clear what constitutes a good superpixel algorithm. In an effort to understand the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance. We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient, improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward to extend to supervoxel generation.},

abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we address both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky $\backslash$etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.},

abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult-to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.},

When trained on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets.

abstract = {Boundary and edge cues are highly beneficial in improving a wide variety of vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, object recognition, stereo, and object proposal generation. Recently, the problem of edge detection has been revisited and significant progress has been made with deep learning. While classical edge detection is a challenging binary problem in itself, the category-aware semantic edge detection by nature is an even more challenging multi-label problem. We model the problem such that each edge pixel can be associated with more than one class as they appear in contours or junctions belonging to two or more semantic classes. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end deep semantic edge learning architecture based on ResNet and a new skip-layer architecture where category-wise edge activations at the top convolution layer share and are fused with the same set of bottom layer features. We then propose a multi-label loss function to supervise the fused activations. We show that our proposed architecture benefits this problem with better performance, and we outperform the current state-of-the-art semantic edge detection methods by a large margin on standard data sets such as SBD and Cityscapes.},

@article{Wegner2010,
abstract = {State-of-the-art satellite SAR sensors acquire data of one meter geometric ground resolution, airborne sensors achieve even higher resolutions. Nonetheless, layover and occlusion hamper interpretability of such data particularly in urban scenes. In order to overcome this drawback, we use additional information from aerial photos to detect buildings. Features are extracted from both data sets and introduced to a common feature vector followed by a classification into building sites and non-building sites with Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Furthermore, we show that the different sensor geometries of the SAR and the optical sensor may be used to estimate building heights.},

@article{Krizhevsky2012,
abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSRVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

@article{Moon2002,
abstract = {We propose an approach to accurately detecting two-dimensional (2-D) shapes. The cross section of the shape boundary is modeled as a step function. We first derive a one-dimensional (1-D) optimal step edge operator, which minimizes both the noise power and the mean squared error between the input and the filter output. This operator is found to be the derivative of the double exponential (DODE) function, originally derived by Ben-Arie and Rao. We define an operator for shape detection by extending the DODE filter along the shape's boundary contour. The responses are accumulated at the centroid of the operator to estimate the likelihood of the presence of the given shape. This method of detecting a shape is in fact a natural extension of the task of edge detection at the pixel level to the problem of global contour detection. This simple filtering scheme also provides a tool for a systematic analysis of edge-based shape detection. We investigate how the error is propagated by the shape geometry. We have found that, under general assumptions, the operator is locally linear at the peak of the response. We compute the expected shape of the response and derive some of its statistical properties. This enables us to predict both its localization and detection performance and adjust its parameters according to imaging conditions and given performance specifications. Applications to the problem of vehicle detection in aerial images, human facial feature detection, and contour tracking in video are presented.},
